Jon Ipsaro is a Senior Scientist at Atavistik Bio in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Originally a Cleveland native, he completed his PhD at Northwestern University under Dr. Alfonso Mondrag√≥n studying the molecular interactions between spectrin and ankyrin.  He then moved to Long Island for post-doctoral research with Dr. Leemor Joshua-Tor, detailing the molecular underpinnings of RNA interference. His current research leverages integrated biological methods &mdash; including biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and computational biology &mdash; to identify and characterize novel binding sites for small molecule drug targeting.
