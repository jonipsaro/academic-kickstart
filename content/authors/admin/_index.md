Jon Ipsaro is a Research Specialist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Originally a Cleveland native, he completed his PhD at Northwestern University under Dr. Alfonso Mondrag√≥n studying the molecular interactions between spectrin and ankyrin.  Since moving to Long Island, Jon has worked with Dr. Leemor Joshua-Tor to detail the molecular underpinnings of RNA interference. His research leverages integrated biological methods &mdash; including biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, next-gen sequencing, and computational biology &mdash; to gain insight into gene regulatory mechanisms.
