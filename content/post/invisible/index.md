## Public Presentation: Molecular Photography
Every other year, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory hosts a full-day Open House.  The event welcomes our Long Island community (and others!) for a full day of campus tours, demonstrations, and short science talks.  I was fortunate to be selected to highlight the motivations, methods, and magic of structural biology which allows us to peer into the invisible world of molecules.
