abstract: <img src='featured.png' alt='Structure of tandem ZU5 domains' style='width:50%;float:right'>Members of the diverse heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family play crucial roles in heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Despite the similar affinities of their chromodomains for di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3), different HP1 proteins exhibit distinct chromatin-binding patterns, likely due to interactions with various specificity factors. Previously, we showed that the chromatin-binding pattern of the HP1 protein Rhino, a crucial factor of the <I>Drosophila</I> PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, is largely defined by a DNA sequence-specific C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein named Kipferl (Baumgartner <I>et al.</I>, 2022). Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction between Rhino and its guidance factor Kipferl. Through phylogenetic analyses, structure prediction, and <I>in vivo</I> genetics, we identify a single amino acid change within Rhino's chromodomain, G31D, that does not affect H3K9me2/3 binding but disrupts the interaction between Rhino and Kipferl. Flies carrying the <I>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></I> mutation phenocopy <I>kipferl</I> mutant flies, with Rhino redistributing from piRNA clusters to satellite repeats, causing pronounced changes in the ovarian piRNA profile of <I>rhino<sup>G31D</sup></I> flies. Thus, Rhino's chromodomain functions as a dual-specificity module, facilitating interactions with both a histone mark and a DNA-binding protein.
