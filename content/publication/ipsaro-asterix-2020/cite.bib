	abstract = {The piRNA pathway safeguards genomic integrity by silencing transposable elements in the germline. While Piwi is the central piRNA factor, others including Asterix/Gtsf1 have also been demonstrated to be critical for effective silencing. Here, using eCLIP with a custom informatic pipeline, we show that Asterix/Gtsf1 specifically binds tRNAs in cellular contexts. We determined the structure of mouse Gtsf1 by NMR spectroscopy and identified the RNA binding interface on the protein{\textquoteright}s first zinc finger, which was corroborated by biochemical analysis as well as cryo-EM structures of Gtsf1 in complex with co-purifying tRNA. We further show that LTR retrotransposons are preferentially de-repressed in Asterix mutants. Given the role of tRNAs as LTR retrotransposon primers, our work implicates Asterix/Gtsf1 as exploiting tRNA dependence to identify transposon transcripts and promote piRNA silencing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
